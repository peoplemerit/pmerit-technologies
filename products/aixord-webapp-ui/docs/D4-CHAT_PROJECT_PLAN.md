# D4-CHAT PROJECT PLAN

## 2.5 Execution Architecture (Planned)
This section describes the Human-AI manager/employee model, hybrid execution (autonomous + user-guided), approval gates with thresholds, mathematical governance (conservation law, readiness metric), DAG enforcement, Poka-Yoke, session awareness, and GT2UTM verification.

## 3.6 Artifact Persistence & GT2UTM (Planned)
This section outlines the mandatory artifact commit layer, Environment Awareness Report (EAR-01), artifact persistence enforcement, GT2UTM mapping table, and the fixes identified.

## 2.1 AIXORD v4.5 Governance Reference
Patches PATCH-ABL-PERSIST-GT2UTM-02 and PATCH-GOV-EXEC-01 extend the baseline with formal governance for agentic systems and artifact persistence enforcement doctrine (APED).

## 2.4.X AIXORD Baseline Extensions (Planned)
This subsection documents:
- Human-AI Hierarchy (Director/Supervisor/Worker roles)
- Approval Gate Record requirement
- Mathematical Governance Layer (Conservation Law, Readiness Formula, Irreversibility Rule)
- DMAIC mapping to AIXORD phases
- GT2UTM (Governance to UI Traceability Matrix) as required artifact
- APED (Artifact Persistence Enforcement Doctrine) with 6 rules

## GT2UTM Mapping Table
