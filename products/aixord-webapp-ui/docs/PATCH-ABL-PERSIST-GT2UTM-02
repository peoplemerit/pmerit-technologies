AIXORD_OFFICIAL_ACCEPTABLE_BASE…

1. Baseline Gap Identified

Baseline enforces:

Artifact Binding (L-AB)

No action without binding

Lifecycle instructions

But it does NOT explicitly require:

A system-level mandatory persistence enforcement mechanism in AI platforms that claim file writing capability.

This creates a structural blind spot:
Governance assumes persistence,
but platform may not enforce commit.

2. Required Baseline Addition

Add New Doctrine:

PART X-A — Artifact Persistence Enforcement Doctrine (APED)
Definition

AI-generated artifacts that are required by governance MUST be persisted through a mandatory commit layer.
Chat output alone is not sufficient evidence of execution.

APED-1 — Persistence Is Not Implied

If platform claims workspace/file capability:

Artifact existence MUST be proven by file evidence

Chat claim ≠ persistence

APED-2 — Mandatory Commit Layer

Systems implementing AIXORD MUST:

Provide a non-skippable artifact commit mechanism

Return file path + hash evidence

Block phase advancement if evidence missing

APED-3 — Persistence Visibility

UI MUST expose:

Last artifact write timestamp

Files written

Hashes

Commit status

If not visible → governance opacity violation.

APED-4 — Environment Awareness Requirement

Platforms with file integration MUST provide:

Write proof test

Read proof test

Hash compare

Binding metadata display

Failure → GA:ENV incomplete.

APED-5 — Session Continuity Enforcement

If system supports multi-session project governance:

Session reopening MUST be deterministic

Session ID MUST be URL-resolvable or explicitly selectable

Session artifacts MUST be bindable

Failure → L-SSC violation.

APED-6 — GT2UTM Enforcement

If governance state changes:

UI MUST map:

Governance event → Persistence action → Evidence display

Unmapped governance state = traceability failure.

3. Why This Patch Is Required

From Test-issues evidence 

Test-issues

:

The platform:

Bound workspace

Read files

Generated work

Did not persist artifacts

This reveals:

Baseline enforces artifact binding at reasoning layer
But does not enforce artifact commit at tool layer.

APED closes that gap.

4. Non-Impact Statement

This patch:

Adds no new GA gates

Does not alter phase ordering

Does not change Formula

Does not change Authority model

Only enforces deterministic persistence

Compliant with:

L-FX

L-SSC

L-AB

L-AVL

L-SPG

L-PS

5. Acceptance Criteria for Baseline Patch

Baseline updated if:

APED doctrine inserted

No gate reordering

No authority change

Persistence enforcement clearly defined

GT2UTM traceability requirement documented

Final Strategic Outcome

After both patches:

D4-CHAT becomes:

Artifact deterministic

Environment provable

Session traceable

Governance-to-UI aligned

Baseline becomes:

Tool-layer aware

Persistence-enforcing

GT2UTM-compatible

Resistant to “illusion of work”
