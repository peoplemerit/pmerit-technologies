HANDOFF ② — PROJECT PLAN UPDATE
PATCH-D4-EXEC-ARCH-01

Title: Agentic, Mathematical, and Governance-Bound Execution Architecture
Applies To: D4-CHAT_PROJECT_PLAN.md
Source: D4-CHAT_PROJECT_PLAN.md (Canonical)
Authority: Director
Patch Class: PROJECT PLAN ENRICHMENT
Status: AUTHORIZED

1. PURPOSE

This patch updates the D4-CHAT Project Plan to explicitly reflect the architecture already designed and discussed, including:

Human–AI manager/employee model

Hybrid execution (autonomous + user-guided)

Mathematical readiness and conservation

DAG, Poka-Yoke, reconciliation

Session awareness & persistent memory

GT2UTM-driven UI verification

2. INSERT — EXECUTION ARCHITECTURE (AUTHORITATIVE)
2.1 Human–AI Hierarchy (PLANNED SYSTEM)

Human (Owner / Director)

Provides objectives

Approves gates

Owns LOCK decisions

Supervisor AI (High-Reasoning)

Parses criteria

Generates plans

Calculates Readiness Metric (R)

Requests approval

Worker / Autonomous Agent

Executes atomic steps:

CREATE_FILE

API_TEST

RUN_COMMAND

Cannot promote phases

2.2 Hybrid Execution Strategy (PLANNED)

Strategy A — Autonomous

Code generation

API testing

Tool-driven execution (GitHub Copilot, agents)

Strategy B — User-Guided

Database migrations

Deployment

High-risk operations

Verifiable instructions + automated checks

Hybrid Matrix determines execution mode per task.

2.3 Approval Gates (PLANNED)

Threshold: R ≥ 0.8

Physical UI block until human clicks Approve

Approval stored with user_id and evidence

2.4 Mathematical Governance (PLANNED)

Master Formula

EXECUTION_TOTAL = FORMULA_EXECUTION + VERIFIED_REALITY


Work Units (WU) tracked

Transfer only after verification

DMAIC-mapped validation (V)

2.5 DAG, Poka-Yoke, Reconciliation (PLANNED)

scope_dependencies table enforces DAG

No cyclic execution

Reconciliation Triad:

PLANNED

CLAIMED

VERIFIED

Divergence requires Director decision

2.6 Session Awareness & Memory (PLANNED)

Persistent agent state via Durable Objects

Centralized projects table = Source of Truth

All sessions read/write same state

2.7 GT2UTM (PLANNED & REQUIRED)

GT2UTM maps:

Governance Artifact
→ UI Element
→ Component
→ API Call
→ State Change
→ Evidence


GT2UTM is required before:

VERIFY

LOCK

3. IMAGE CONTENT (INCORPORATED AS PLANNED DESIGN)

The following concepts from the provided image are explicitly adopted as planned system behavior:

Human–AI Manager–Employee hierarchy

Approval Gates with thresholds

Hybrid execution (autonomous + human)

Conservation Law & Readiness Metric

DMAIC-based validation

DAG & Poka-Yoke enforcement

Session awareness via persistent memory

Central Source of Truth

Visual explanation of Work Units (WU)

These are now canonical design intent.

4. NON-GOALS

This patch does not:

Commit to final UI styling

Lock implementation language

Guarantee timelines

5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

Patch complete when:

Architecture sections added

Math & hierarchy explicit

GT2UTM referenced as required

Image concepts fully reflected

Canonical Project Statement

D4-CHAT is not a chatbot. It is a governed, agentic project execution system where human authority, mathematical truth, and UI behavior are continuously reconciled.
