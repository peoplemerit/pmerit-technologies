<h2>Stop Re-Explaining Your Project to AI Every Single Session</h2>

<b>Are you tired of wasting the first 15 minutes of every coding session rebuilding context with your AI assistant?</b>

You explain your architecture to Claude... again. You wrote specs last week, but the codebase changed. Claude Web knows your strategy but can't see your code. Claude Code can implement but doesn't understand the big picture.

<b>The Scope Order System fixes this.</b>

<h2>NEW in Version 3.0</h2>

• <b>Living Documents</b> — Scopes update in place, no more bloated append-only files
• <b>Decision Log</b> — Track all architectural choices (ACTIVE/NO-GO/EXPERIMENTAL)
• <b>File Locking</b> — Protect completed features from accidental regression
• <b>Lifecycle Archive</b> — Auto-cleanup of obsolete documentation
• <b>Linked Handoffs</b> — One handoff per scope, always current

<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

This book teaches you a <b>Reality-First methodology</b> for structured collaboration between you and your AI assistants:

• <b>Three-Way Team Structure</b> — Clear roles for Claude Web (Architect), You (Director), and Claude Code (Implementer)
• <b>Hierarchical Scope Management</b> — Per-feature documentation that persists across sessions
• <b>Reality-First Workflow</b> — Audit what exists BEFORE writing specs, eliminating wasted work
• <b>Session Continuity</b> — Never lose progress between coding sessions again
• <b>Decision Tracking</b> — Permanent record of what worked and what didn't

<h2>Who Is This For?</h2>

✓ Solo developers using AI-augmented development
✓ Small teams (1-5 developers) coordinating AI tools
✓ Anyone frustrated with AI context limits and session resets
✓ Developers who value documentation and structured workflows
✓ Teams who want to preserve architectural decisions

<b>Not for:</b> Teams with existing robust project management, or developers who don't use AI assistants.

<h2>The Origin</h2>

This system was developed through <b>65+ real development sessions</b> building a production web application. Version 3.0 introduces living documents and decision tracking — learned from managing complex features that need protection from regression.
