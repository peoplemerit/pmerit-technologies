## THE PROBLEM

### Sound familiar?

- You explain your project architecture to Claude... **again**
- You wrote specs last week, but the codebase has changed since then
- Claude Web knows your strategy but can't see your code
- Claude Code can implement but doesn't understand the big picture
- You waste the first 10 minutes of every session rebuilding context
- Progress notes are scattered across 47 chat logs

### The real cost:

Every time you re-explain context, you're burning:
- **Tokens** (money)
- **Time** (your most valuable resource)
- **Mental energy** (context switching kills productivity)

---

## THE SOLUTION

### Scope Order System

A **Reality-First** methodology that creates structured collaboration between you, Claude Web, and Claude Code.

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ CLAUDE WEB  │◄────►│     YOU     │◄────►│ CLAUDE CODE │
│ (Architect) │      │ (Director)  │      │(Implementer)│
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

**Claude Web** handles strategy and specifications.
**You** make decisions and coordinate.
**Claude Code** audits reality and implements.

### The Key Innovation: Reality-First

Traditional workflow:
```
Write Spec → Implement → Discover spec was wrong → Redo work
```

Scope Order workflow:
```
Audit Reality → Write Spec Based on Facts → Implement → Done
```

No more outdated specs. No more wasted implementation cycles.

## WHO IS THIS FOR?

### Perfect for you if:

- You use Claude Web AND Claude Code (or similar AI tools)
- You work on projects with multiple features
- You're frustrated with AI context limits
- You value documentation and structured workflows
- You want to stop re-explaining your architecture

### Not for you if:

- You don't use AI assistants in development
- You work only on tiny one-off scripts
- You already have robust project management

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### The 15-Minute Setup

1. Create the directory structure
2. Copy the templates
3. Customize with your project name
4. Setup Claude Web instructions
5. Commit to git
6. Start using!

### The Daily Workflow

```
1. Start session: "MYPROJECT CONTINUE"
2. Claude Code reads state, outputs status
3. Create new scope or load existing
4. Work with clear context
5. RESEARCH_FINDINGS updated automatically
6. Repeat tomorrow with full context
```

### The Feature Workflow

```
1. Create empty scope file
2. "AUDIT SCOPE: FEATURE" → Claude Code checks reality
3. Share audit with Claude Web
4. Brainstorm specs together
5. "SCOPE UPDATED: FEATURE" → Claude Code implements
6. Repeat until feature complete
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need Claude Pro?

**A:** Yes, for Claude Code. Claude Web works with free tier but Pro is recommended.

### Q: Does this work with GPT/Copilot?

**A:** The templates are Claude-focused, but the methodology works with any AI assistant. You may need to adapt the commands.

### Q: How long does setup take?

**A:** 15 minutes for basic setup. Most users are fully productive within their first session.

### Q: Is this just documentation templates?

**A:** It's a complete methodology with templates, workflows, and a command system. The magic is in how they work together.

### Q: What if I already have project docs?

**A:** The system complements existing documentation. Your project docs feed into the MASTER_SCOPE.

## Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, r/programming)

**Title:** I built a system to make Claude Web + Claude Code actually work together

**Body:**
After 50+ development sessions using both Claude Web and Claude Code, I was frustrated:

- Claude Web knew my strategy but couldn't see code
- Claude Code could implement but didn't know the big picture
- I was re-explaining context every single session
- Specs became outdated before implementation

So I built the Scope Order System:

1. **Reality-First Workflow** — Claude Code audits what actually exists before you write specs
2. **Scope Files** — Per-feature documentation with context that persists
3. **Three-Way Collaboration** — Clear roles for Claude Web (architect), you (director), Claude Code (implementer)

The key innovation is auditing reality first. No more writing specs based on assumptions, then discovering the codebase is different.

It's a methodology + template pack. 15 minutes to setup.
