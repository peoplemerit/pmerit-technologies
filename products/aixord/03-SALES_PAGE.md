---

## TAGLINE

**Authority. Execution. Confirmation.**

---

## THE PROBLEM

### Sound familiar?

- You explain your project architecture to Claude... **again**
- You ask for help and get 5 different suggestions instead of clear steps
- Your AI "forgets" decisions you already made
- You debate implementation approaches during execution (instead of just executing)
- Context is lost, progress is scattered, and every session feels like starting over

### The real cost:

Every time you re-explain context, you're burning:
- **Tokens** (money)
- **Time** (your most valuable resource)
- **Mental energy** (context switching kills productivity)

And the deeper problem:
- AI treats you like the decision-maker **and** the executor
- You negotiate with AI mid-task instead of following a plan
- No clear boundary between "deciding what to do" and "doing it"

---

## THE SOLUTION

### AIXORD: AI Execution Order Framework

A methodology inspired by military OPORD (Operations Order) doctrine that creates structured, authoritative AI-human collaboration.

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ CLAUDE WEB  │◄────►│     YOU     │◄────►│ CLAUDE CODE │
│ (Architect) │      │ (Director)  │      │ (Commander) │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
    Research            Decisions           Execution
    Strategy            Approvals            Orders
    Specs               Coordination         Steps
```

### The Core Principle

> **The human decides WHAT should be done; the AI decides HOW it is executed.**

During brainstorming: AI is your analyst.
After decisions are approved: AI becomes your commander.

### The Role Transition

This is the key innovation:

```
Phase 1: BRAINSTORMING
├── AI operates as analyst/architect
├── You discuss, debate, explore
└── Decisions are made and approved

↓ ROLE TRANSITION (Explicit) ↓

Phase 2: EXECUTION
├── AI switches to command mode
├── AI issues orders, not suggestions
├── Decisions are FROZEN
└── You execute and confirm
```

No more negotiating during execution. No more revisiting decisions mid-task.

## AIXORD POWER RULES

Memorize these. They change everything:

1. **"If it's not documented, it doesn't exist."**
2. **"Completion is a locked state, not a feeling."**
3. **"Decisions are frozen before execution begins."**
4. **"Scopes open only when prerequisites are verified."**
5. **"Execution enforces decisions; it does not revisit them."**
6. **"Only one AI may issue execution orders at a time."**

## WHO IS THIS FOR?

### Perfect for you if:

- You use AI assistants in development (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot)
- You work on complex projects with multiple features
- You're frustrated with AI that "forgets" or re-negotiates
- You want clear authority structure, not collaborative chaos
- You value documentation and systematic workflows

### Not for you if:

- You prefer fully autonomous AI (AIXORD is human-in-the-loop)
- You work only on tiny one-off scripts
- You prefer unstructured, ad-hoc AI conversations
- You're allergic to documentation

## HOW IT WORKS

### The 30-Minute Setup

1. Create the directory structure
2. Copy the templates
3. Customize with your project name
4. Fill out MASTER_SCOPE with your vision
5. Setup Claude Web instructions
6. Commit to git
7. Start using!

### The Daily Workflow

```
1. Start session: "MYPROJECT CONTINUE"
2. AI reads state, outputs status
3. Load active scope
4. Work with clear authority boundaries
5. AI issues orders, you execute
6. Confirm completion with evidence
7. Context saved for next session
```

### The Feature Workflow

```
1. "AUDIT SCOPE: FEATURE" → AI checks reality
2. Share audit with Architect AI
3. Brainstorm specs together (AI = analyst)
4. Approve decisions
5. "SCOPE UPDATED: FEATURE" → AI switches to commander
6. AI issues execution orders (decisions FROZEN)
7. Execute each step, confirm with evidence
8. Feature complete → scope LOCKED
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need Claude Pro?

**A:** Recommended but not required. The methodology works with any AI that accepts file uploads (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).

### Q: Is this just documentation templates?

**A:** It's a complete methodology with templates, workflows, and a command system. The innovation is the formal separation of decision authority from execution authority.

### Q: What if my AI doesn't follow the AIXORD rules?

**A:** AIXORD is a protocol imposed on the AI, not a suggestion. You enforce compliance by resetting context and reloading governance files. The human controls the context.

### Q: Can I still discuss options with AI?

**A:** Yes — during the brainstorming phase. But once decisions are approved, execution begins and decisions are frozen. If execution reveals problems, you halt and return to decision phase.

### Q: How is this different from just writing good prompts?

**A:** AIXORD is a complete governance system, not a prompt technique. It includes state tracking, scope management, dependency locking, and formal role transitions. Prompts are part of it, but it's much more.

**AIXORD: AI Execution Order Framework**
*A Methodology for AI-Human Collaboration*

Stop asking your AI for suggestions. Start giving it orders.

AIXORD is a complete methodology for developers who want structured, authoritative AI-human collaboration. Inspired by military OPORD doctrine, it creates clear boundaries between deciding what to do (your job) and deciding how to do it (AI's job).

**What You'll Learn:**
- The role transition from AI-as-analyst to AI-as-commander
- How to freeze decisions before execution begins
- Scope locking and dependency management
- Failure handling that treats problems as signal, not error
- AI compliance enforcement (you control the context)

**What's Included:**
- Complete methodology with 8 parts
- Ready-to-use templates (CLAUDE.md, STATE.json, scopes)
- Quick Start Guide (30-minute setup)
- System Guide for deep reference

**The Core Insight:**
*The human decides WHAT should be done; the AI decides HOW it is executed.*

Perfect for solo developers, small teams, and anyone frustrated with AI that forgets, re-negotiates, or suggests when it should command.

Authority. Execution. Confirmation.

## Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, r/programming)

**Title:** I built AIXORD: A system where AI gives orders, not suggestions

**Body:**
After 75+ development sessions with Claude, I noticed a pattern:

I kept negotiating with the AI during execution. We'd already decided what to do, but mid-task I'd ask "what do you think?" and get 5 new options. Hours lost.

The problem: No clear boundary between deciding and doing.

So I built AIXORD (AI Execution Order):

1. **Role Transition** — AI switches from "analyst" to "commander" after decisions are approved
2. **Frozen Decisions** — Once execution begins, decisions are locked. No revisiting.
3. **Sequential Orders** — AI issues one step at a time. You execute and confirm with evidence.
4. **Scope Locking** — Completed features are locked. Dependencies must be verified before opening new scopes.

The core principle:
> The human decides WHAT should be done; the AI decides HOW it is executed.

It's inspired by military OPORD doctrine. Structured. Authoritative. No ambiguity.

Methodology + templates. 30 minutes to setup.
