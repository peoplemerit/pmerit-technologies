### Description

*(Copy from 03-SALES_PAGE.md "Amazon KDP Description" section)*

**AIXORD: AI Execution Order Framework**
*A Methodology for AI-Human Collaboration*

Stop asking your AI for suggestions. Start giving it orders.

AIXORD is a complete methodology for developers who want structured, authoritative AI-human collaboration. Inspired by military OPORD doctrine, it creates clear boundaries between deciding what to do (your job) and deciding how to do it (AI's job).

**What You'll Learn:**
- The role transition from AI-as-analyst to AI-as-commander
- How to freeze decisions before execution begins
- Scope locking and dependency management
- Failure handling that treats problems as signal, not error
- AI compliance enforcement (you control the context)

**What's Included:**
- Complete methodology with 8 parts
- Ready-to-use templates (CLAUDE.md, STATE.json, scopes)
- Quick Start Guide (30-minute setup)
- System Guide for deep reference

**The Core Insight:**
*The human decides WHAT should be done; the AI decides HOW it is executed.*

Perfect for solo developers, small teams, and anyone frustrated with AI that forgets, re-negotiates, or suggests when it should command.

Authority. Execution. Confirmation.
