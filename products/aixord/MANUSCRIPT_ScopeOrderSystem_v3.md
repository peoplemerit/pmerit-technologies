---

# Part I: The Problem and Solution

## The Problem

Developers using AI assistants face critical challenges:

### 1. Context Fragmentation

- Claude Web knows your strategy but can't see your code
- Claude Code can implement but doesn't know the big picture
- GitHub Copilot suggests code without understanding your architecture
- **Result:** Inconsistent implementations, repeated explanations

### 2. Specification Drift

- You write specs, then implement
- Implementation reveals issues with specs
- Specs become outdated
- Next session, you work from wrong assumptions
- **Result:** Wasted work, regressions, confusion

### 3. Session Continuity Loss

- AI assistants forget everything between sessions
- You re-explain context every time
- Progress notes scattered across chat logs
- **Result:** Slow startups, lost decisions, repeated work

### 4. Role Confusion

- When should AI plan vs implement?
- Who approves changes?
- Where do decisions get recorded?
- **Result:** Chaotic workflow, unclear ownership

### 5. Document Staleness (NEW in v3)

- Append-only docs become bloated
- Old audit reports mixed with new
- Can't find current state
- Multiple handoffs contradict each other
- **Result:** Information overload, trust erosion

### 6. Lost Decisions (NEW in v3)

- "Why did we do it this way?" - No one remembers
- Rejected ideas get re-proposed
- No record of what was tried and failed
- **Result:** Circular discussions, repeated mistakes

---

## The Solution: Scope Order System v3

A **methodology + template pack** that creates structured collaboration between you and your AI assistants.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Reality-First Workflow (from v2)

```
Traditional (Spec-First):
  Write Spec -> Implement -> Discover spec was wrong -> Redo

Scope Order (Reality-First):
  Audit Reality -> Write Spec Based on Facts -> Implement -> Update Findings
```

#### 2. Living Documents (NEW in v3)

```
Traditional (Append-Only):
  Session 1: Add audit
  Session 2: Add another audit
  Session 3: Now 3 audits to read, which is current?

Living Documents (Update in Place):
  Session 1: Write audit
  Session 2: Replace audit with new findings
  Session 3: Only current audit exists
```

#### 3. Decision Log (NEW in v3)

```
Every architectural decision is tracked permanently:

| Decision | Date | Rationale | Status |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| Use JWT | 2025-01-15 | Stateless | ACTIVE |
| Use sessions | 2025-01-10 | Tried, failed | NO-GO |
| Try Redis | 2025-01-18 | Testing | EXPERIMENTAL |
```

### Three-Way Team Structure

```
+-------------+      +-------------+      +-------------+
| CLAUDE WEB  |<---->|     YOU     |<---->| CLAUDE CODE |
| (Architect) |      | (Director)  |      |(Implementer)|
+-------------+      +-------------+      +-------------+
     |                     |                     |
     | Strategy            | Decisions           | Execution
     | Brainstorming       | Approvals           | Quality Review
     | Specifications      | Coordination        | Implementation
```

### Hierarchical Scope Management

```
MASTER_SCOPE.md          <- Project vision (sum of all scopes)
    |
    +-- SCOPE_AUTH.md        <- Authentication (living document)
    |       +-- HANDOFF_AUTH.md   <- Linked handoff
    |
    +-- SCOPE_DASHBOARD.md   <- Dashboard (living document)
    |       +-- HANDOFF_DASHBOARD.md
    |
    +-- SCOPE_PAYMENTS.md    <- Payments (living document)
            +-- HANDOFF_PAYMENTS.md
```

Each scope contains:
- **DECISION LOG** - Permanent record (NEVER deleted)
- **AUDIT_REPORT** - Current reality (replaced each audit)
- **HANDOFF_DOCUMENT** - Specifications (updated in place)
- **RESEARCH_FINDINGS** - Latest session (old sessions archived)
- **LOCKED FILES** - Protection for complete features
- **DEPENDENCIES** - How scopes relate

# Part II: Complete Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/scopes
mkdir -p docs/aados
mkdir -p docs/handoffs
mkdir -p docs/archive
```

## Step 2: Copy Templates

Place the template files:

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md              <- Claude Code instructions
├── CLAUDE_WEB_SYNC.md     <- Claude Web mirror
├── SYSTEM_GUIDE.md        <- Full documentation
└── scopes/
    └── MASTER_SCOPE.md    <- Project vision

docs/
├── aados/
│   ├── STATE.json         <- State pointer
│   ├── GOVERNANCE.md      <- Workflow rules
│   └── TASK_TRACKER.md    <- Task status
├── handoffs/              <- One per scope
└── archive/               <- Obsolete content
```

## Step 3: Customize Templates

Replace all `[BRACKETED]` placeholders:

| Placeholder | Replace With | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `[PROJECT NAME]` | Your project name | MyApp |
| `[PROJECT]` | Short command prefix | MYAPP |
| `[DATE]` | Today's date | 2025-01-15 |

## Step 4: Fill Out MASTER_SCOPE.md

Define your project vision:

- Project identity and mission
- Technical architecture decisions
- Track/phase structure
- Dependencies

## Step 5: Create First Scope

Option A (Recommended): Prompt Claude Code directly:
```
AUDIT SCOPE: AUTH
```

Option B: Create empty file first:
1. Create `.claude/scopes/SCOPE_AUTH.md`
2. Create `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_AUTH.md`
3. Commit to repo
4. Run `AUDIT SCOPE: AUTH`

## Step 6: Start Working

```
MYAPP CONTINUE
```

Claude Code will:
1. Read governance files
2. Check active scope
3. Verify git sync
4. Output status
5. Resume work

# Part III: Living Documents System

## The Problem with Append-Only

Traditional documentation appends new content:

```markdown
## Session 1 - Jan 1
Audit findings...

## Session 2 - Jan 5
New audit findings...

## Session 3 - Jan 10
Even more audit findings...
```

**Problems:**
- Which audit is current?
- 90% of content is outdated
- Context window bloated
- Contradictions between sections

## Living Document Approach

Update in place:

```markdown
## AUDIT_REPORT
Last Audit: Jan 10

[Current findings only]
```

**Benefits:**
- Always current
- Minimal context needed
- No contradictions
- Easy to find information

## What Gets Updated vs Archived

| Section | Update Behavior |
|---------|-----------------|
| DECISION LOG | **NEVER** deleted or archived |
| SCOPE IDENTITY | Updated when feature changes |
| AUDIT_REPORT | Replaced each audit |
| HANDOFF_DOCUMENT | Updated with new requirements |
| RESEARCH_FINDINGS | Latest session only (old archived) |
| CURRENT STATE | Checkboxes updated |

## When to Archive

| Content Type | Archive When |
|--------------|--------------|
| Old audit reports | Replaced by new audit |
| Superseded research | Implementation changed |
| Rejected approaches | Marked NO-GO |
| Session transcripts | > 5 sessions old |

## Archive Location

```
docs/archive/
├── SCOPE_AUTH/
│   ├── 2025-01-01_audit.md
│   └── 2025-01-05_research.md
└── SCOPE_DASHBOARD/
    └── 2025-01-10_rejected_approach.md

# Part V: Example Workflow

## Scenario: Adding User Authentication

### Day 1: Audit

**You:** `AUDIT SCOPE: AUTH`

**Claude Code:**
1. Checks existing code
2. Documents current state
3. Identifies gaps
4. Populates AUDIT_REPORT

**Result:** SCOPE_AUTH.md has reality-based findings

### Day 2: Specification

**You → Claude Web:** Share audit report

**Claude Web:**
1. Reviews findings
2. Proposes approach
3. Documents requirements
4. Updates HANDOFF_DOCUMENT

**Result:** SCOPE_AUTH.md has specifications

### Day 3: Implementation

**You:** `SCOPE UPDATED: AUTH`

**Claude Code:**
1. Reviews specifications
2. Recommends any improvements
3. Implements approved solution
4. Updates RESEARCH_FINDINGS (replaces, not appends)
5. Records decisions in DECISION LOG

**Result:** Feature implemented, documented

### Day 4: Completion

**You:** Mark scope COMPLETE

**Claude Code:**
1. Locks critical files
2. Prompts for archive cleanup
3. Updates STATE.json

**Result:** Feature protected, docs cleaned

# Part VI: Decision Log System

## Why Track Decisions?

1. **Prevent circular discussions** - "We tried that, it didn't work"
2. **Preserve rationale** - "Why did we choose this?"
3. **Block bad ideas permanently** - NO-GO means never
4. **Track experiments** - EXPERIMENTAL may become ACTIVE

## Decision Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `ACTIVE` | In use now | Implement and maintain |
| `NO-GO` | Rejected permanently | NEVER implement |
| `EXPERIMENTAL` | Testing | May promote or demote |

## Examples

```markdown
## DECISION LOG

| Decision | Date | Rationale | Status |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| JWT for auth | 2025-01-15 | Stateless, scalable | ACTIVE |
| Server sessions | 2025-01-10 | Too much server load | NO-GO |
| Redis caching | 2025-01-18 | Testing performance | EXPERIMENTAL |
| bcrypt passwords | 2025-01-15 | Industry standard | ACTIVE |
| MD5 hashing | 2025-01-10 | Insecure | NO-GO |
```

## Rules

1. DECISION LOG is NEVER deleted
2. NO-GO decisions stay forever (warnings for future)
3. EXPERIMENTAL may become ACTIVE or NO-GO
4. Every significant choice gets logged

---

# Part VII: Archive Lifecycle

## Scope Status Levels

| Status | Meaning | Archive Behavior |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `PLANNING` | Early ideas | Archive everything |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Building | Archive pivots only |
| `STABILIZING` | Testing | Suggest cleanup |
| `COMPLETE` | Done | Auto-prompt delete |

## Archive Flow

```
PLANNING ────> IN_PROGRESS ────> STABILIZING ────> COMPLETE
    │              │                  │                │
    │              │                  │                │
Archive        Archive           Prompt           Prompt
everything     pivots            cleanup          delete
```

## Cleanup Prompt

When scope reaches COMPLETE:

```
🧹 SCOPE AUTH is COMPLETE.

Archive files found:
- 2025-01-01_audit.md (30 days old)
- 2025-01-05_research.md (25 days old)

Suggest: Delete archive files? Feature is stable.
[YES] [KEEP 30 MORE DAYS] [KEEP FOREVER]
```

---

# Troubleshooting

## Q: What if I need to modify a locked file?

**A:** Use the unlock command:
```
UNLOCK: path/to/file.js
```

Make changes, verify functionality, then:
```
RELOCK: path/to/file.js
```

## Q: Can I reopen a COMPLETE scope?

**A:** Yes, change status back to IN_PROGRESS. Locked files remain locked until explicitly unlocked.

## Q: What if I lose archive files?

**A:** Archive files are optional reference. The living document contains all current information.

## Q: How do I handle multiple features in parallel?

**A:** Each feature gets its own scope. Set `active_scope` in STATE.json to switch context.

# About the Author

The Scope Order System was developed by PMERIT LLC while building the PMERIT AI Educational Platform. After struggling with context limits across 60+ sessions of AI-augmented development, we created this methodology to maintain perfect continuity.

**What started as internal tooling became a product** when we realized every developer using AI faces the same challenges.
