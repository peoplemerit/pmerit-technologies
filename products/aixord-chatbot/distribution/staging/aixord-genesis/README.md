## What Makes Genesis Special

Genesis is designed for **greenfield projects** — when you start with nothing but an idea.

### The Metamorphosis Pattern

```
Session 1:  IDEA → Brief description + initial decisions
Session 2:  IDEA → HANDOFF emerges, RESEARCH begins
Session 3+: IDEA → SCOPEs decompose, implementation starts
Final:      IDEA → Production-Ready System
```

### Single-File Architecture

Your project lives in ONE file that grows with you:
- Governance at the top
- Decisions accumulate
- Research findings capture discoveries
- SCOPEs emerge when complexity warrants

When your file exceeds ~1,000 lines, expand to a folder structure.

## Quick Start

1. Open any AI chatbot (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
2. Copy the entire contents of `AIXORD_GENESIS.md`
3. Paste as your first message
4. Describe your project idea
5. AI will ask clarifying questions
6. Decisions get documented
7. Use `HANDOFF` at session end
8. Paste handoff at next session start

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `ENTER DECISION MODE` | Open discussion |
| `ENTER EXECUTION MODE` | Freeze decisions, implement |
| `HALT` | Stop everything |
| `STATUS` | Report current state |
| `HANDOFF` | Generate session summary |
| `APPROVED` | Proceed with proposal |

---

## Token Tracking

Genesis includes built-in token awareness:
- **70% used:** Warning
- **80% used:** Alert — handoff soon
- **85% used:** Auto-trigger handoff

Never lose work to context limits.

## When to Use SCOPE Templates

Use the included templates when:
- Your project has 3+ distinct components
- Components have different lifecycles
- You need to track completion per-feature
