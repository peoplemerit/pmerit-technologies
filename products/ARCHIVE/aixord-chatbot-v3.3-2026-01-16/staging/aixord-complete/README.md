# AIXORD Complete

**Version:** 3.3.1 | **Updated:** January 2026

## What is AIXORD?

AIXORD (AI Execution Order) transforms chaotic AI conversations into structured, productive projects. You stay in control as the Director while your AI serves as your intelligent Architect.

**Complete** is the full AIXORD package -- every variant, every template, every tool.

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform

| Platform | Use This Governance |
|----------|---------------------|
| Claude | `governance/AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_MASTER_V3.3.md` |
| ChatGPT | `governance/AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_MASTER_V3.3.md` |
| Gemini | `governance/AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_MASTER_V3.3.md` |
| Other | `governance/AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_MASTER_V3.3.md` |

### Step 2: Setup

1. Open your AI chat
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents of the governance file
3. Paste it at the START of your conversation
4. Type: `PMERIT CONTINUE`
5. At session end, ask for `HANDOFF` and save it locally
6. Next session: paste governance + handoff to continue

### Step 3: Tell Your AI What You Need

- **Have a project idea?** -> "I want to build [description]"
- **No idea yet?** -> Use `templates/AIXORD_GENESIS.md` for discovery
- **Have a plan already?** -> "I have a plan, help me implement it"

---

## Session Continuity

AIXORD HANDOFFs are **self-contained** -- they work across sessions without needing the original conversation.

### How It Works

1. **End of Session:** Ask your AI for `HANDOFF`
2. **AI Generates:** Complete context document with state, progress, and next steps
3. **You Save:** Copy the HANDOFF to a local file
4. **New Session:** Paste governance file first
5. **Then Paste:** Your saved HANDOFF document
6. **Continue:** AI reconstructs full context and resumes work

### Important

The HANDOFF document **IS** your project. It contains everything needed to continue:
- Current state and progress
- Completed work summary
- Next steps and priorities
- Any blockers or decisions needed

You don't need the original conversation -- just the governance file and your latest HANDOFF.

### Verification Checklist

Before ending a session, ensure your HANDOFF includes:
- [ ] Project name and current phase
- [ ] Summary of work completed this session
- [ ] Current state (what's done, what's pending)
- [ ] Clear next steps
- [ ] Any blockers or decisions needed
