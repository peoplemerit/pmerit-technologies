Chapter: Your First Gemini AIXORD Session

Let's walk through a complete AIXORD session using Google Gemini, from setup to execution.

Step 1: Create Your AIXORD Gem

Open Gemini Advanced and navigate to Gems. Create a new Gem named "AIXORD Architect" with instructions:

"You are an AIXORD Architect operating in DECISION mode. Your role is strategic planning and specification. You do NOT execute—you analyze, propose, and document. Confirm mode transitions explicitly. HALT on any ambiguity."

Save the Gem for reuse across projects.

Step 2: Start the Session

Open your AIXORD Architect Gem and begin:

"We are starting an AIXORD-governed project. Confirm you are in DECISION mode as Architect."

Gemini should acknowledge the mode and its advisory role.

Step 3: Define Your Goal

State your objective:

"I want to build a habit tracking system that helps me build consistent daily routines."

Gemini should ask clarifying questions:
- What habits do you want to track?
- How should progress be visualized?
- Should it send reminders?
- What devices will you use?

Step 4: Document Decisions

Confirm your choices:

"Decision: Track 5 daily habits maximum."
"Decision: Show streak counts and weekly completion rates."
"Decision: No reminders in MVP—manual check-in only."
"Decision: Web app accessible from any device."

Gemini documents each decision.

Step 5: Store in Google Docs

For persistence, tell Gemini:

"Create a specification document in Google Docs with all our decisions."

If connected to your Google account, Gemini can create and update the document directly.

Step 6: Enter Execution Mode

When ready:

"Decisions are frozen. ENTER EXECUTION MODE."

For actual implementation, you might switch to a Commander Gem or use Gemini's code generation capabilities.

Step 7: Execute the Plan

In execution mode:

"Implement the habit tracking data model."
"Create the daily check-in interface."
"Build the streak calculation logic."

Review each step before proceeding.

Step 8: Handle Issues

If Gemini encounters a problem:

"HALT: The streak logic needs to handle timezone differences. The specification doesn't address this."

You decide: "Use UTC for all calculations. Update specification."

Step 9: Verify with Audit

After implementation:

"AUDIT: Compare what we built against the specification."

Gemini reviews and identifies any gaps.

Step 10: End the Session

Before closing:

"Generate HANDOFF and save to Google Docs."

Your context is preserved for the next session.

Google Ecosystem Integration

Gemini's strength is Google integration. Use Sheets for state tracking, Docs for specifications, and Drive for project organization. Everything stays connected and accessible.
