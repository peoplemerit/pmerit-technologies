## What is AIXORD?

AIXORD (AI Execution Order) transforms chaotic AI conversations into structured, productive projects. You stay in control as the Director while your AI serves as your intelligent Architect.

**Genesis** is the idea-to-system variant -- designed to help you create projects from scratch using the SCOPE GENESIS protocol.

## Session Continuity

AIXORD HANDOFFs are **self-contained** -- they work across sessions, platforms, and even different AI models.

### How It Works

1. **End Session** - Use `HANDOFF` command to generate session state
2. **Save HANDOFF** - Copy the generated HANDOFF to a local file
3. **New Session** - Start fresh conversation on any AI platform
4. **Paste AIXORD** - Paste AIXORD_GENESIS.md to initialize
5. **Paste HANDOFF** - Paste your saved HANDOFF file
6. **Continue** - AI resumes exactly where you left off

### Important

The HANDOFF **is** the project. It contains everything needed to continue:
- Current phase and progress
- All decisions made
- SCOPEs created or in progress
- Next actions queued

### Verification Checklist

Before ending a session, ensure your HANDOFF includes:
- [ ] Project name and phase
- [ ] All completed SCOPEs
- [ ] Current SCOPE status
- [ ] Pending decisions
- [ ] Next recommended action
