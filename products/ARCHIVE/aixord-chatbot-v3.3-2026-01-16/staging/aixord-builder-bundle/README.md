# AIXORD Builder Bundle

**Version:** 3.3.1 | **Updated:** January 2026

## What is AIXORD?

AIXORD (AI Execution Order) transforms chaotic AI conversations into structured, productive projects. You stay in control as the Director while your AI serves as your intelligent Architect.

**Builder Bundle** includes all templates for building complex, multi-scope projects -- ideal for developers and power users.

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Any AI Chat

Builder Bundle works with any AI platform (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

### Step 2: Setup

1. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_UNIVERSAL_V3.3.md`
2. Paste it at the START of your conversation
3. Type: `PMERIT CONTINUE`
4. At session end, ask for `HANDOFF` and save it locally
5. Next session: paste governance + handoff to continue

### Step 3: Tell Your AI What You Need

- **Have a project idea?** -> "I want to build [description]"
- **No idea yet?** -> Use `AIXORD_GENESIS.md` for project discovery
- **Have a plan already?** -> "I have a plan, help me implement it"

That's it. AIXORD guides you from there.

---

## Session Continuity

AIXORD HANDOFFs are **self-contained** -- they work across sessions without requiring the original project files.

### How It Works

1. **At session end:** Ask for `HANDOFF`
2. **AI generates:** Complete context snapshot
3. **You save:** Copy HANDOFF to local file
4. **Next session:** Paste governance + HANDOFF
5. **AI restores:** Full project context
6. **You continue:** Exactly where you left off

### Important

The HANDOFF document **IS** your project. It contains everything needed to resume:
- Current phase and status
- All decisions made
- Work completed
- Next actions queued

You don't need the original files -- just governance + HANDOFF.

### Verification Checklist

Before ending a session, confirm your HANDOFF includes:
- [ ] Project name and phase
- [ ] Current SCOPE status
- [ ] Recent decisions
- [ ] Pending tasks
- [ ] Any blockers or notes
