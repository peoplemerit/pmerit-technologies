### 3B: Update "What's Included" Reference in Manuscripts

The manuscripts currently mention `templates/` folder which only exists in Builder and Complete packages. Two options:

**OPTION A (Recommended):** Remove `templates/` reference from manuscripts for products that don't have it.

**OPTION B:** Add templates/ folder to all ZIPs (more work, but consistent).

**Decision Required from Director:** Which option?

For now, proceed with **Option A** — update the "What's Included" section in 6 manuscripts to NOT mention templates/:
- MANUSCRIPT_STARTER
- MANUSCRIPT_CLAUDE
- MANUSCRIPT_CHATGPT
- MANUSCRIPT_GEMINI
- MANUSCRIPT_COPILOT
- MANUSCRIPT_GENESIS

---

## PHASE 4: STARTER PRODUCT VERIFICATION

The AIXORD Starter product and discount code AX-STR-7K9M were NOT visible in the Gumroad screenshots.

**Director must verify:**
1. Does `https://meritwise0.gumroad.com/l/aixord-starter` exist?
2. Is the discount code AX-STR-7K9M configured?
3. If not, create the product and discount code OR remove MANUSCRIPT_STARTER from KDP upload
