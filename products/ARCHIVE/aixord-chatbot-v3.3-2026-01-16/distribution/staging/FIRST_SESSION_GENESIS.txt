Chapter: Your First Genesis Session

Let's walk through creating a new project from nothing but an idea using the Genesis methodology.

Step 1: Start Fresh

Open your AI assistant and establish the Genesis context:

"We are starting a Genesis project under AIXORD governance. I have an idea but no specifications yet. You are in DECISION mode as Architect. The goal is to evolve from IDEA to SYSTEM."

The AI should acknowledge Genesis mode and prepare for open exploration.

Step 2: State Your Idea

Share your raw concept:

"I want to build a personal finance tracker that helps me understand where my money goes each month."

At this stage, the idea is intentionally vague. Genesis is designed for discovery.

Step 3: Explore Through Questions

The AI should ask clarifying questions:
- What platforms should it run on?
- How will you input transactions?
- What insights do you want to see?
- Should it connect to bank accounts or be manual entry?

Answer honestly, even if your answer is "I don't know yet." Genesis captures uncertainty.

Step 4: Document Decisions

As you make choices, the AI documents them:

"Document Decision: Manual entry only for MVP. No bank connections."
"Document Decision: Web application using React."
"Document Decision: Categories: Food, Transport, Housing, Entertainment, Other."

Each decision gets logged with rationale.

Step 5: Watch It Evolve

Your Genesis file grows organically:
- IDEA section captures the original concept
- DECISIONS section logs each choice
- RESEARCH section notes technical findings
- SCOPES section emerges as work units become clear

Step 6: Transition to Execution

When specifications are solid:

"The Genesis DECISION phase is complete. Generate the HANDOFF for EXECUTION."

The AI produces a complete specification derived from your exploration.

Key Genesis Principles

Single File: Everything stays in one document that evolves
Discovery First: You don't need to know everything upfront
Decisions Accumulate: Each choice builds on previous ones
Natural Progression: IDEA → DECISIONS → RESEARCH → SCOPES → SYSTEM

Genesis transforms vague ideas into executable specifications through structured conversation.
