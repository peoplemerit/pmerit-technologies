Chapter: Your First Claude AIXORD Session

Let's walk through a complete AIXORD session using Claude, from setup to execution.

Step 1: Create Your Claude Project

Open claude.ai and navigate to Projects. Create a new project named "AIXORD [Your Project Name]". In the Project Knowledge section, paste your AIXORD governance instructions from the downloaded templates.

Step 2: Start the Session

In your new project, begin with:

"We are operating under AIXORD governance. You are in DECISION mode as Architect. Confirm you understand the authority model."

Claude should acknowledge DECISION mode and confirm understanding of the roles.

Step 3: Define Your Goal

State what you want to build:

"I want to create a simple bookmark manager that saves links with tags and lets me search them."

Claude should ask clarifying questions:
- Where should bookmarks be stored?
- What technology stack?
- Should it have a UI or be command-line?

Step 4: Make and Document Decisions

Answer Claude's questions and confirm decisions:

"Decision: Store bookmarks in a local JSON file."
"Decision: Build as a Node.js CLI tool."
"Decision: Support add, search, list, and delete commands."

Claude documents each decision in your specification.

Step 5: Enter Execution Mode

When planning is complete:

"Decisions are frozen. ENTER EXECUTION MODE."

Claude should confirm the transition and switch to Commander role.

Step 6: Execute Step by Step

Claude implements according to specification:

"Step 1: Create package.json with required dependencies."
"Step 2: Create bookmarks.js with core functions."
"Step 3: Create cli.js with command handlers."

Review each step before Claude proceeds.

Step 7: Handle Issues

If Claude encounters a problem:

"HALT: The 'commander' package API has changed. The specification assumed v8 syntax but v11 is installed."

You decide: "Update the specification to use v11 syntax. Continue."

Step 8: Verify with Audit

After implementation:

"AUDIT: Compare the implementation against our specification."

Claude reviews and reports any discrepancies.

Step 9: End the Session

Before closing:

"Generate HANDOFF for session continuity."

Claude produces a document capturing all context for your next session.

The Dual Workflow Advantage

For larger projects, use Claude Web as Architect and Claude Code as Commander. Web handles planning; Code handles implementation. This separation makes the authority model even clearer.
