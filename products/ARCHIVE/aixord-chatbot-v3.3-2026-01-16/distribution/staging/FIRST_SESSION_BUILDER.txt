Chapter: Your First Multi-Platform AIXORD Session

Let's walk through using AIXORD across multiple AI platforms strategically.

Step 1: Choose Your Platforms

For this session, we'll use:
- Claude for complex planning (Architect role)
- ChatGPT for creative content (brainstorming)
- Copilot for code execution (Commander role)

Each platform has strengths. Use them strategically.

Step 2: Start with Claude as Architect

Open Claude and establish governance:

"We are operating under AIXORD governance. You are the permanent Architect for this project. You will plan and specify, but execution happens elsewhere. Confirm."

Claude acknowledges its strategic role.

Step 3: Define the Project

State your goal:

"I want to build a landing page for a SaaS product that converts visitors to trial signups."

Claude asks strategic questions:
- What is the product?
- Who is the target audience?
- What is the primary conversion goal?
- What sections should the page include?

Step 4: Brainstorm with ChatGPT

For creative elements, switch to ChatGPT:

"I need compelling headline options for a project management tool targeting small teams. Give me 10 variations."

ChatGPT generates creative options. Select the best ones.

Step 5: Document in Claude

Return to Claude with your choices:

"Decision: Headline is 'Finally, a project tool your team will actually use.'"
"Decision: Sections are Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, CTA."
"Decision: Color scheme is blue and white, professional but friendly."

Claude updates the specification.

Step 6: Generate HANDOFF

When planning is complete:

"Generate a HANDOFF document for the Commander who will implement this landing page."

Claude produces a detailed specification with all decisions documented.

Step 7: Execute with Copilot

Open your IDE with Copilot. Paste the HANDOFF:

"HANDOFF received. ENTER EXECUTION MODE. Implement according to this specification."

Copilot reads the spec and begins implementation.

Step 8: Execute Section by Section

"Implement the Hero section with the headline and primary CTA."
"Implement the Features section with the three main features."
"Implement the Testimonials section with placeholder content."

Review each section before proceeding.

Step 9: Visual Audit Preparation

When implementation is complete:

"Generate a VISUAL AUDIT checklist based on the specification."

This checklist guides your screenshot review.

Step 10: Complete the Loop

Take screenshots and compare against specification. If discrepancies exist, return to Copilot for fixes.

Cross-Platform Handoffs

The key to multi-platform AIXORD is the HANDOFF document. It carries context between platforms. Each AI reads the same specification, ensuring consistency despite using different tools.
