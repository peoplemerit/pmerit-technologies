Chapter: Your First AIXORD Session

Let's walk through a complete AIXORD session step by step, applicable to any AI platform.

Step 1: Establish Governance

Open your AI assistant and set the context:

"We are operating under AIXORD governance. You are in DECISION mode as Architect. I am the Director with supreme authority. Confirm you understand the roles."

The AI should acknowledge DECISION mode and confirm understanding of the authority model.

Step 2: Define Your Goal

State what you want to accomplish:

"I want to build a simple todo list application with the ability to add, complete, and delete tasks."

The AI should ask clarifying questions:
- What technology stack?
- Where should tasks be stored?
- What interface—web, mobile, or command line?
- Any specific features beyond the basics?

This is correct Architect behavior—exploring requirements before committing.

Step 3: Make Decisions

Answer the AI's questions. Be specific:

"Decision: Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks."
"Decision: Store tasks in browser localStorage."
"Decision: Web interface with a simple form and task list."
"Decision: Tasks have text and a completed status."

Each decision gets documented. The AI should confirm what's been decided.

Step 4: Freeze Decisions

When requirements are clear:

"Decisions are complete. Document the full specification."

The AI produces a specification summarizing everything decided. Review it carefully.

Step 5: Enter Execution Mode

When ready to build:

"ENTER EXECUTION MODE."

The AI should explicitly confirm the mode transition. From this point, decisions are frozen. The AI is now Commander.

Step 6: Execute Step by Step

The AI implements exactly what was specified:

"Step 1: Creating index.html with basic structure."
"Step 2: Adding CSS for layout and styling."
"Step 3: Implementing JavaScript for task management."

Review each step. If something doesn't match the spec, speak up.

Step 7: Handle HALT Conditions

If the AI encounters ambiguity:

"HALT: The specification doesn't define what happens when localStorage is full. How should I handle this?"

You decide: "Display an error message asking user to delete old tasks. Update specification."

The AI resumes with your clarification.

Step 8: Audit the Result

When implementation is complete:

"AUDIT: Compare the implementation against our specification."

The AI reviews what was built versus what was specified, reporting any discrepancies.

Step 9: Visual Audit (if applicable)

For UI work:

"VISUAL AUDIT: I will provide screenshots for verification."

Share screenshots. The AI compares them against the specification and reports PASS or DISCREPANCY for each element.

Step 10: End the Session

Before closing:

"Generate HANDOFF for session continuity."

The AI produces a document capturing:
- What was built
- Decisions made
- Any pending work
- Current state

Save this document. Use it to resume in your next session.

Key Takeaways

The flow is always: DECISION → EXECUTION → AUDIT

Mode transitions are explicit. The AI confirms each transition.

HALT is not failure—it's the system working correctly.

Documents are the system. If it's not written down, it doesn't exist.

You are always the Director. You make the final calls.
