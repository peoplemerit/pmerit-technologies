Chapter: Your First ChatGPT AIXORD Session

Let's walk through a complete AIXORD session using ChatGPT, from setup to execution.

Step 1: Configure Custom Instructions

Before starting, set up your Custom Instructions. Go to Settings, then Personalization, then Custom Instructions. In the "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?" section, add:

"You operate under AIXORD governance. Always start in DECISION mode as Architect. Confirm mode transitions explicitly. HALT on ambiguity. Never execute without approved specifications."

This ensures every conversation starts AIXORD-aware.

Step 2: Start the Session

Open a new chat and verify the setup:

"Confirm you are operating under AIXORD governance in DECISION mode."

ChatGPT should acknowledge DECISION mode and its role as Architect.

Step 3: Define Your Goal

State what you want to build:

"I want to create a meal planning assistant that suggests weekly menus based on dietary preferences."

ChatGPT should explore requirements:
- What dietary restrictions to support?
- How many meals per day?
- Should it generate shopping lists?
- What format for output?

Step 4: Document Decisions

As you make choices, confirm them:

"Decision: Support vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options."
"Decision: Plan breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 7 days."
"Decision: Generate a consolidated shopping list."
"Decision: Output as markdown tables."

ChatGPT logs each decision for the specification.

Step 5: Enter Execution Mode

When ready to build:

"Decisions are complete. ENTER EXECUTION MODE."

ChatGPT confirms the transition and becomes Commander.

Step 6: Execute with Code Interpreter

If you have Code Interpreter enabled:

"Create the meal planning logic as a Python script."

ChatGPT writes and tests the code directly, showing you results.

Step 7: Handle HALT Conditions

If ChatGPT encounters ambiguity:

"HALT: The specification doesn't define portion sizes. Should meals be for 1 person or family-sized?"

You clarify: "Single person portions. Update specification and continue."

Step 8: Verify Results

After execution:

"AUDIT: Does the output match our specification?"

ChatGPT compares results against requirements and reports any gaps.

Step 9: Save Your Work

Before ending:

"Generate HANDOFF document for this session."

Copy and save the handoff. Paste it at the start of your next session to maintain continuity.

Using Custom GPTs

For dedicated AIXORD workflows, create a Custom GPT with full governance rules baked in. This ensures consistent behavior and eliminates the need to re-establish rules each session.
