## THE PROBLEM

### Sound familiar?

- You start a new ChatGPT session and it has **no idea** what your project is
- You spend 15 minutes **re-explaining context** before getting any work done
- The AI "forgets" decisions you made **yesterday**
- Your project information is scattered across **dozens of chat logs**
- You can't afford Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus

### The real cost:

Every session reset means:
- **Time wasted** re-explaining
- **Mental energy** rebuilding context
- **Progress lost** to fragmented conversations
- **Decisions forgotten** and revisited

And the deeper problem:
- Free chatbots have **no memory**
- No folder access, no project instructions
- Just a blank chat window every time

---

## THE SOLUTION

### AIXORD Chatbot Edition

A single-file methodology that gives any chatbot instant project context.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           YOUR PROJECT FILE                     │
│                                                 │
│  • Upload at session start                      │
│  • AI reads full context instantly              │
│  • Work with structured workflow                │
│  • Update file at session end                   │
│  • Context persists forever                     │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How It Works

**Session 1:**
1. Create your project file (15 minutes, once)
2. Upload to ChatGPT/Gemini
3. Type "[PROJECT] CONTINUE"
4. AI knows everything, starts working
5. Type "HANDOFF" at end
6. Update file with AI's output

**Session 2, 3, 4...:**
1. Upload same file
2. "[PROJECT] CONTINUE"
3. Continue exactly where you left off
4. Update and save

**No re-explaining. No context loss. No subscription required.**

## THE TWO-SECTION ARCHITECTURE

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TOP SECTION (Dynamic)                          │
│  • What to work on NOW                          │
│  • Active decisions                             │
│  • Current constraints                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  BOTTOM SECTION (Cumulative)                    │
│  • Project state (grows over time)              │
│  • Research findings                            │
│  • Decision log                                 │
│  • Completed tasks                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Top section drives the session. Bottom section preserves history.

## FAQ

### Q: I have ChatGPT Plus. Should I get this?

**A:** If you don't have Claude Pro with Claude Code, yes. ChatGPT Plus still doesn't have persistent project memory across sessions.

### Q: How is this different from full AIXORD?

**A:** Full AIXORD uses multiple files, folder structures, and Claude Code's instruction panel. Chatbot Edition puts everything in ONE uploadable file for simpler chatbots.

### Q: What if my file gets too big?

**A:** The guide includes token management and archiving strategies. You'll learn to keep files lean while preserving essential context.

### Q: Can I use this for any project type?

**A:** Yes — software development, writing, research, business planning, any multi-session project.

### Q: What if the AI ignores the rules?

**A:** The guide includes enforcement prompts. You control the context.
