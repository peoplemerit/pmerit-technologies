# AIXORD for Gemini Advanced — Quick Start Guide

**Version:** 3.1.3 | **Platform:** Google Gemini Advanced ($19.99/mo)

---

## ⚠️ QUICK NOTE

**Setting up a Gem?** Paste `AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_GEMINI_V3.1.md` into the Gem's **Instructions** field.

This quick-start guide is for **reading**, not pasting into Gemini.

---

## 🎯 YOUR ADVANTAGE: GEMS

As a Gemini Advanced subscriber, you have access to **Gems** — custom AI personas with persistent instructions and knowledge. This means you can create an **AIXORD Gem** that remembers governance rules, so you never have to paste the governance file again.

---

## ⚡ SETUP (One-Time, ~5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Gems
1. Go to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
2. Click **"Gems"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"+ New Gem"** (or "Create Gem")

### Step 2: Configure Your AIXORD Gem

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| **Name** | `AIXORD` (or your project name) |
| **Instructions** | Paste the ENTIRE contents of `AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_GEMINI_V3.1.md` |

**⚠️ Paste the GOVERNANCE file, NOT this quick-start guide!**

### Step 3: Add Knowledge Files (Optional but Recommended)
Click **"Add files"** and upload:
- Your PROJECT_DOCUMENT.md (if you have one)
- Previous HANDOFF files
- Reference materials for your project

### Step 4: Save
Click **"Save"** — your AIXORD Gem is ready!

## 🚀 USING YOUR AIXORD GEM

### Starting a Session
1. Click your **AIXORD Gem** in the Gems sidebar
2. Type: `PMERIT CONTINUE`
3. Enter your license email or code when prompted
4. Say: `Gem` (to confirm Tier A setup)
5. Start working!

### Session Flow
```
You: PMERIT CONTINUE
Gemini: [Asks for license]
You: [your-email@example.com or authorization code]
Gemini: [Asks for tier]
You: Gem
Gemini: [Shows session status, ready for direction]
You: [Your directive - DISCOVER, BRAINSTORM, or EXECUTE]
```

### Ending a Session
Your context is saved within the Gem. Just close the tab.

**However:** Gemini will proactively generate HANDOFFs when context fills. When you see one, save it locally as backup.

---

## 🔄 PROACTIVE HANDOFF SYSTEM

Even with Gems, Gemini will:
- Track context usage automatically
- Generate HANDOFFs at ~80% context capacity
- Alert you when it's time to save

**You don't need to remember to request HANDOFFs** — Gemini handles this for you.

### When Gemini Generates HANDOFFs

| Trigger | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| Context ~80% full | 🟡 HANDOFF generated, save recommended |
| Context ~95% full | 🔴 EMERGENCY HANDOFF, save immediately |
| Major milestone | Checkpoint offered |
| Phase transition | Transition HANDOFF generated |

---

## 🔧 RECOVERY (If Session Lost)

If your Gem session ends unexpectedly:

1. Open your AIXORD Gem
2. Type: `PMERIT RECOVER`
3. Describe what you were working on OR paste your last HANDOFF
4. Gemini will reconstruct context

---

## 📁 PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE

After license validation, you'll choose your folder approach:

- **Option A (Recommended):** Absolute AIXORD Structure with screenshot verification
- **Option B:** User-controlled structure

For Gem users, Option A is especially valuable—you can upload your entire organized project folder to the Gem's Knowledge section.

### Recommended Structure (Option A)

```
[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]/
├── 1_GOVERNANCE/
│   └── AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_GEMINI_V3.1.md
├── 2_STATE/
│   └── AIXORD_STATE.json
├── 3_PROJECT/
│   └── PROJECT_DOCUMENT.md
├── 4_HANDOFFS/
│   └── (session handoffs saved here)
├── 5_OUTPUTS/
│   └── (your deliverables)
└── 6_RESEARCH/
    └── (reference materials)
```

### Uploading to Gem Knowledge

Upload these files to your Gem's Knowledge section:

| File | Purpose | When to Add |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `PROJECT_DOCUMENT.md` | Project specs & status | After DOCUMENT phase |
| `HANDOFF_[DATE].md` | Session continuity | After each major session |
| `REFERENCE_*.md` | Project-specific docs | As needed |

---

## 🆚 WITH GEM vs WITHOUT GEM

| Experience | Without Gem | With Gem |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Session start | Paste governance (30 sec) | Just open Gem (instant) |
| Project context | Paste HANDOFF | Already in Knowledge |
| Governance rules | Re-loaded each time | Persistent |
| Setup effort | Every session | One time |
| HANDOFF tracking | Manual | Automatic |

**Verdict:** If you have Gemini Advanced, always use a Gem for AIXORD projects.

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Gemini doesn't recognize PMERIT CONTINUE"
- Make sure you opened your AIXORD **Gem**, not regular Gemini chat
- Verify governance is in the Gem's Instructions field

### "Gemini forgets my project context"
- Upload your PROJECT_DOCUMENT.md to Gem Knowledge
- Save HANDOFF backups locally for critical milestones

### "I want to work on multiple projects"
- Create one Gem per project (e.g., "AIXORD - Website", "AIXORD - App")
- Each Gem has its own Instructions and Knowledge

### "Session ended without HANDOFF"
- Open your Gem and type: `PMERIT RECOVER`
- Describe what you were working on
- Gemini will help reconstruct
