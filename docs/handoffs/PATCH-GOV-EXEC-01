HANDOFF ① — BASELINE PATCH
PATCH-GOV-EXEC-01

Title: Formal Governance Extensions for Agentic, Mathematical, and UI-Bound Systems
Applies To: AIXORD_OFFICIAL_ACCEPTABLE_BASELINE_v4_4.md
Authority: Director (Human)
Patch Class: BASELINE EXTENSION (Non-Breaking)
Status: AUTHORIZED FOR INTEGRATION

1. PURPOSE

This patch formally extends AIXORD v4.4 to recognize and govern modern agentic systems that include:

Human–AI managerial hierarchies

Autonomous and user-guided hybrid execution

Mathematical governance (conservation, readiness, irreversibility)

Session-persistent AI systems

Governance-to-UI verification (GT2UTM)

All concepts already implicitly compatible with v4.4 are now explicitly declared and enforceable.

2. GAP BEING CLOSED (BASELINE)
Identified Gaps

Baseline v4.4 currently:

Assumes AI execution but does not name agent roles

Describes gates but not human approval records

Enforces verification but does not declare readiness math

Audits artifacts but does not bind UI surfaces

Assumes continuity but does not declare session persistence

This patch does not change behavior — it formalizes authority.

3. BASELINE ADDITIONS (NORMATIVE)
3.1 Human–AI Hierarchy (DECLARATION)

Add a new subsection:

Human–AI Execution Hierarchy

Role	Authority
Director / Owner (Human)	Decides WHAT may proceed; final approval authority
Supervisor (High-Reasoning AI)	Plans, analyzes, calculates readiness, requests approval
Worker / Agent (Task AI)	Executes atomic steps only after authorization

No AI role may bypass Director approval for phase promotion or LOCK.

3.2 Approval Gate Record (REQUIRED)

Declare:

All approval gates MUST record:

user_id

timestamp

decision (approve / reject / feedback)

Absence of a human decision record = INVALID GATE

3.3 Mathematical Governance (DECLARATION)

Add a Mathematical Governance Layer:

Conservation Law

EXECUTION_TOTAL = FORMULA_EXECUTION + VERIFIED_REALITY


Readiness Formula

R = L × P × V


Irreversibility Rule

VERIFIED → LOCK is forward-only

Regression without Director override = violation

3.4 Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC) Mapping

Declare DMAIC as a recognized quality lens:

DMAIC	AIXORD
Define	DECISION / DISCOVER
Measure	BRAINSTORM / PLAN
Analyze	BLUEPRINT
Improve	EXECUTE
Control	AUDIT → VERIFY → LOCK
3.5 GT2UTM (Governance → UI Traceability Matrix)

Add a new required artifact:

GT2UTM is mandatory for any system with a user interface and is required to pass VERIFY prior to LOCK.

Failure conditions:

Missing UI mapping → FAIL

UI deviates from governance → FAIL

FAIL → HALT

4. NON-GOALS (STRICT)

This patch does NOT:

Add new phases

Change gate order

Mandate UI design choices

Require users to calculate formulas

5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

Patch is complete when:

Hierarchy is explicit

Math is declared

GT2UTM is enforceable

LOCK irreversibility is codified

Canonical Baseline Statement

AIXORD v4.4 governs not only plans and artifacts, but autonomous agents, human authority, mathematical truth, and user-visible system behavior.
