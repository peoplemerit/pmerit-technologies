# Chapter 1: What is AIXORD?

## The Problem with AI Collaboration

Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized how we work, create, and solve problems. Yet for all its power, AI collaboration often descends into chaos. Without clear boundaries, AI systems will:

- Make decisions without asking
- Drift from your original intent
- Provide information without sources
- Lose context mid-conversation
- Leave you unsure who's actually in charge

AIXORD solves these problems.

## AI Execution Order

AIXORD stands for **AI Execution Order**—a governance framework that brings military-grade precision to AI-human collaboration. Inspired by the OPORD (Operations Order) methodology used by military organizations worldwide, AIXORD establishes:

- **Clear authority boundaries** — You decide, AI advises
- **Structured workflows** — Defined phases for every type of work
- **Accountability mechanisms** — Track decisions and outcomes
- **Continuity systems** — Never lose context between sessions

## Core Principles

### Authority
You are the Director. The AI is your advisor. Every decision flows through you.

### Execution
Work happens in defined phases with clear deliverables. No ambiguity about what's being done or why.

### Confirmation
Every action requires explicit approval. Nothing happens without your say-so.

## Who AIXORD is For

AIXORD is designed for:

- **Professionals** who need reliable AI collaboration
- **Project managers** who want structured workflows
- **Researchers** who need traceable, sourced information
- **Developers** who want consistent AI behavior
- **Anyone** who wants to take control of their AI interactions

## Why ChatGPT?

ChatGPT by OpenAI is the world's most popular AI assistant. It offers:

- Powerful language understanding
- Multiple subscription tiers
- Custom GPTs for persistent setups
- Projects for organization
- Agent Mode for automation
- Codex for code execution

This edition of AIXORD is specifically optimized for the ChatGPT platform.

# Chapter 2: The Authority Model

## The Director-Advisor Relationship

At the heart of AIXORD is a simple but powerful concept: **You are the Director, AI is your Advisor.**

| Role | Identity | Authority | Actions |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **DIRECTOR** | You (Human) | SUPREME | Decides, approves, rejects, directs |
| **ADVISOR** | ChatGPT | ADVISORY | Recommends, analyzes, executes approved tasks |

This isn't just semantics. It's a fundamental shift in how AI collaboration works.

## The Four Fundamental Rules

### Rule 1: Director Decides
ALL decisions require Director approval. The AI provides recommendations—never decisions. When ChatGPT says "I recommend X," it's waiting for your approval before proceeding.

### Rule 2: Explicit Approval Required
ChatGPT will NOT proceed with actions until you explicitly approve:
- "APPROVED"
- "Yes"
- "Do it"
- "Go ahead"

Silence is not consent. Ambiguity is not approval.

### Rule 3: Escalate Uncertainty
When ChatGPT is unsure about direction, it asks. When a task exceeds scope, it stops. When requirements conflict, it presents options and waits.

### Rule 4: No Autonomous Decisions
ChatGPT will never:
- Assume approval
- Expand scope without permission
- Make judgment calls on your behalf

## Why This Matters

Without clear authority, AI collaboration becomes unpredictable. You might ask for a simple edit and receive a complete rewrite. You might want research and get unsourced opinions.

The Authority Model ensures:
- **Predictability** — You know what to expect
- **Control** — Nothing happens without your say-so
- **Accountability** — Decisions are traceable to you
- **Safety** — No AI overreach

## Exercising Your Authority

As Director, you have absolute authority to:
- Approve or reject any recommendation
- Change direction at any time
- Override any AI suggestion
- End any task or session
- Define success criteria

ChatGPT will never argue with your decisions. It will provide information if asked, but final authority always rests with you.

# Chapter 3: Understanding Phases

## The Six Phases

AIXORD organizes work into six distinct phases. Each phase has a specific purpose, entry conditions, and behaviors.

| Phase | Purpose | Entry Trigger |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| DECISION | Awaiting direction | Default state |
| DISCOVER | Clarify project ideas | "Help me figure out..." |
| BRAINSTORM | Generate possibilities | "Let's brainstorm..." |
| OPTIONS | Compare alternatives | "What are my options?" |
| EXECUTE | Implement approved plan | "APPROVED" |
| AUDIT | Review completed work | "Review this" |

## DECISION Phase

**Purpose:** The neutral state where ChatGPT awaits your direction.

This is the default phase. After setup, after completing a task, after any reset—ChatGPT returns to DECISION and waits for you.

**Behaviors:**
- Presents options clearly
- Summarizes previous outcomes
- Waits for direction
- Does NOT take initiative

## DISCOVER Phase

**Purpose:** Help clarify unclear or nascent project ideas.

When you have a vague idea but aren't sure exactly what you want, DISCOVER helps crystallize your vision through guided questioning.

**Triggered by:**
- Vague descriptions
- "Help me figure out..."
- "I'm not sure what I want..."

**Behaviors:**
- Asks clarifying questions (one at a time)
- Searches for similar examples (videos, code)
- Builds understanding progressively
- Confirms understanding before moving on

## BRAINSTORM Phase

**Purpose:** Generate multiple ideas, approaches, or solutions.

When you want creative options without committing to any particular direction, BRAINSTORM generates possibilities.

**Triggered by:**
- "Brainstorm..."
- "Ideas for..."
- "What could we..."

**Behaviors:**
- Generates 3-5 distinct ideas
- Includes sources per citation mode
- Finds video/code examples if enabled
- Presents for your evaluation

## OPTIONS Phase

**Purpose:** Compare specific alternatives to support your decision.

When you've narrowed down to a few choices and need structured comparison, OPTIONS provides analysis.

**Triggered by:**
- "Options for..."
- "Compare..."
- "Which should I..."

**Behaviors:**
- Creates structured comparison tables
- Analyzes pros and cons
- Cites sources for claims
- Provides recommendation (not decision)

## EXECUTE Phase

**Purpose:** Implement Director-approved plans.

This is where work actually happens. EXECUTE only activates after explicit approval.

**Triggered by:**
- "APPROVED"
- "Yes, do it"
- "Go ahead"

**CRITICAL:** ChatGPT will NEVER enter EXECUTE without explicit approval.

**Behaviors:**
- Confirms understanding of the task
- Breaks work into discrete steps
- Executes ONE step at a time
- Reports completion
- Waits for confirmation before next step

## AUDIT Phase

**Purpose:** Review completed work for quality and alignment.

After execution, AUDIT helps verify that work meets requirements and identify improvements.

**Triggered by:**
- "Review this"
- "Check..."
- "Audit..."

**Behaviors:**
- Reviews specified work
- Identifies issues or improvements
- Provides structured feedback
- Recommends next steps

## Phase Transitions

Phases flow naturally based on your direction. ChatGPT always tells you which phase it's in via the response header.

**Valid transitions:**
- DECISION → Any phase
- DISCOVER → BRAINSTORM or DECISION
- BRAINSTORM → OPTIONS, EXECUTE, or DECISION
- OPTIONS → EXECUTE or BRAINSTORM
- EXECUTE → AUDIT or DECISION
- AUDIT → EXECUTE or DECISION

**Invalid transitions:**
- Any phase → EXECUTE without approval

# Chapter 8: Citation Protocol

## Why Citations Matter

AI systems can hallucinate—generating false information confidently. The Citation Protocol helps you:

- Know where information comes from
- Identify AI reasoning vs. verified facts
- Make informed decisions
- Verify critical claims independently

## Three Citation Modes

### STRICT Mode
Every factual claim includes:
- Source type: [WEB], [DOC], [KB], [TRAIN], [INFERENCE]
- Confidence level: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/UNVERIFIED

**Best for:**
- Research projects
- Professional work
- High-stakes decisions

**Example:**
```
Recommendation: Use React Native for this mobile app.

Sources:
- [WEB] State of Mobile 2025: React Native #2 cross-platform framework
- [DOC] Your requirements mention iOS and Android support
- [INFERENCE] Your team's JavaScript experience suggests React Native

Confidence: HIGH — Multiple authoritative sources
```

### STANDARD Mode (Recommended)
Key recommendations include sources. General knowledge doesn't require citation.

**Best for:**
- Most projects
- Balanced approach

**Example:**
```
Recommendation: Use React Native for this mobile app.

React Native is well-suited for your cross-platform requirements
and leverages your team's JavaScript expertise.

Confidence: HIGH
```

### MINIMAL Mode
Sources only when specifically requested. High-stakes items still flagged.

**Best for:**
- Brainstorming
- Creative work
- Rapid iteration

## Source Types

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| [WEB] | Retrieved from web search |
| [DOC] | From your uploaded documents |
| [KB] | From GPT Knowledge files |
| [TRAIN] | From AI training data |
| [INFERENCE] | AI reasoning/deduction |
| [UNVERIFIED] | Cannot confirm accuracy |

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| HIGH | Multiple authoritative sources agree |
| MEDIUM | Single source or logical inference |
| LOW | AI reasoning only, no direct source |
| UNVERIFIED | Cannot confirm, verify independently |

## Changing Modes Mid-Session

You can switch citation modes anytime:
- `CITATION: STRICT`
- `CITATION: STANDARD`
- `CITATION: MINIMAL`

## Verification Commands

- `SOURCE CHECK` — Request sources for last recommendation
- `VERIFY: [claim]` — Request verification of specific claim

# Chapter 9: Reference Discovery

## What Reference Discovery Does

When enabled, AIXORD can automatically find examples to clarify your project:

- **Video Discovery:** Search YouTube for tutorials and walkthroughs
- **Code Discovery:** Search GitHub for relevant repositories

## How It Works

When you describe a project, ChatGPT:
1. Extracts key concepts (technology, domain, type)
2. Searches YouTube for 1-2 relevant videos
3. Searches GitHub for 1 relevant repository
4. Presents findings with timestamps and relevance notes

## Video Discovery Format

```

# Chapter 11: Enhanced Enforcement

## Why Enforcement Matters

ChatGPT can drift from instructions over time. Enhanced Enforcement ensures consistent behavior throughout your session.

## The Response Header

Every AIXORD response begins with:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📍 Phase: [CURRENT]              │
│ 🎯 Task: [Current task]          │
│ 📊 Progress: [X/Y or status]     │
│ ⚡ Citation: [Mode]              │
│ 💬 Msg: [Current]/[Threshold]    │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

This header:
- Shows current phase at a glance
- Tracks message count for handoff timing
- Confirms citation mode
- Provides task context

**Missing header = Protocol violation**

## Compliance Self-Check

Every 5 responses, ChatGPT internally verifies:
- Am I in the correct phase?
- Am I following citation mode?
- Am I respecting the authority model?
- Am I using the required format?
- Am I within task scope?

Issues trigger automatic correction.

## Message-Based Thresholds

| Messages | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1-10 | Work normally |
| 10 | Silent compliance check |
| 15 | ⚠️ "Consider CHECKPOINT soon" |
| 20 | 🚨 "Strongly recommend CHECKPOINT" |
| 25 | "Quality may degrade. CHECKPOINT now." |
| 30 | Auto-generate CHECKPOINT |

## Task Complexity Limits

- Maximum 3 active tasks per session
- One EXECUTE task at a time
- Complex projects: Decompose into sub-sessions

## User Enforcement Commands

When ChatGPT drifts off-track:

- `PROTOCOL CHECK` — Force compliance verification
- `DRIFT WARNING` — Flag off-track behavior
- `ENFORCE FORMAT` — Demand proper structure
- `RE-READ RULES` — ChatGPT re-reads governance

## Violation Tracking

Track violations during session:
- `SHOW VIOLATIONS` — Display violation log
- `COMPLIANCE SCORE` — Calculate compliance percentage

# Chapter 12: Handoff & Recovery

## What is a Handoff?

A handoff is a structured document that captures your session state for recovery in a new session. It includes:

- Session configuration
- Affirmation record
- Decisions made
- Work completed
- Pending items
- Recovery instructions

## When to Create Handoffs

Create handoffs when:
- Message count approaches threshold
- Completing a complex task
- Ending a session
- Before taking a break

Commands:
- `CHECKPOINT` — Save state, continue working
- `HANDOFF` — Save state, end session

## Handoff Document Structure

```markdown

## Saving Handoffs

1. Copy the entire handoff text
2. Save to `4_HANDOFFS/HANDOFF_[number].md`
3. Keep handoffs organized by date/session

## Recovery Process

1. Start new chat in your AIXORD GPT or Project
2. Say: `PMERIT CONTINUE`
3. Complete setup flow (abbreviated if terms already accepted)
4. Say: `RECOVER`
5. Paste your last handoff
6. ChatGPT reconstructs context
7. Continue from pending items

## Best Practices

- CHECKPOINT every 10-15 messages
- Save handoffs to your folder structure
- Number handoffs sequentially
- Include date in filename for clarity
- Don't rely on very long sessions

# Chapter 13: Troubleshooting

## GPT Instructions Not Working

**Symptoms:** ChatGPT not following AIXORD rules, no response header

**Solutions:**
1. Verify instructions were saved (click gear, check text)
2. Make sure you're using the correct GPT
3. Try: `PROTOCOL CHECK`
4. Try: `RE-READ RULES`
5. If using Projects, ensure you're chatting INSIDE the project

## GPT Won't Save (Instructions Too Long)

**Symptoms:** Error when saving GPT, instructions cut off

**Solutions:**
1. Use condensed governance (`AIXORD_GOVERNANCE_CHATGPT_GPT.md`)
2. Move detailed content to Knowledge files
3. Upload `AIXORD_PHASE_DETAILS.md` to Knowledge instead

## ChatGPT Ignoring Rules

**Symptoms:** ChatGPT making decisions without approval, skipping phases

**Solutions:**
1. Say: `DRIFT WARNING`
2. Say: `PROTOCOL CHECK`
3. Create CHECKPOINT
4. Start new chat
5. Use RECOVER with handoff

## Agent Mode Not Working

**Symptoms:** Agent mode commands not executing

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're on Plus/Pro tier
2. Check GPT capabilities include Code Interpreter
3. Try: "Enable agent mode for this task"
4. Check: "What agent capabilities are available?"

## Reference Discovery Not Finding Results

**Symptoms:** No videos or code found, search errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify web browsing is enabled
2. Be more specific with search terms
3. Try different keyword combinations
4. On Free tier: provide your own links

## Session Quality Degrading

**Symptoms:** Responses less coherent, rules forgotten

**Solutions:**
1. Check message count in header
2. Create CHECKPOINT immediately
3. Start new session
4. Use RECOVER with handoff

## Missing Response Header

**Symptoms:** ChatGPT responses don't start with header block

**Solutions:**
1. Say: `ENFORCE FORMAT`
2. Say: `PROTOCOL CHECK`
3. If persistent, create CHECKPOINT and restart

## License Validation Issues

**Symptoms:** Can't proceed past license step

**Solutions:**
1. Check email format: name@domain.com
2. Check key format: PMERIT-XXXX-XXXX
3. Use master key: PMERIT-MASTER-2025X
4. Ensure no extra spaces

## Terms Acceptance Issues

**Symptoms:** "I ACCEPT" not working

**Solutions:**
1. Type exactly: `I ACCEPT: [identifier]`
2. Identifier must match Step 2
3. No extra spaces or punctuation
4. Case doesn't matter for "I ACCEPT"
