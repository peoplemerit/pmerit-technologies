  <h2>Book Description</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Stop fighting your AI. Start collaborating with it.</strong></p>
  
  <p>AIXORD (AI Execution Order) is a governance framework that transforms chaotic Gemini conversations into structured, productive projects. If you've ever lost hours to forgotten context, scope creep, or AI doing things you didn't ask for — this book is for you.</p>
  
  <h3>WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Authority Model</strong> — You are the Director. AI is your Architect and Commander. Clear roles eliminate confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>The Two Kingdoms</strong> — Separate planning (Ideation) from building (Realization) with a mandatory gate between them.</li>
    <li><strong>The DAG System</strong> — Map dependencies so nothing gets built before its prerequisites are complete.</li>
    <li><strong>7 Quality Dimensions</strong> — Evaluate every decision against Best Practices, Completeness, Accuracy, Sustainability, Reliability, User-Friendliness, and Accessibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope Reassessment</strong> — When plans fail, gracefully pivot without losing your progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Session Continuity</strong> — Never lose context between conversations again with the HANDOFF protocol.</li>
  </ul>
